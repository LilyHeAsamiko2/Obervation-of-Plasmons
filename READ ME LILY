It is me, your boyfriend.

I don't know what happened, or why you are ghosting me. After the Earthquake you just stopped talking to me.

And its been 2 months... I miss you, I love you and I am writing this letter to you in tears right now.

I hope you see this message and respond me for once even if it is the last time.

After everything we had together I deserve at least an explanation, or reason of what I did wrong.

I've never wanted to break your heart in any way. You should know that by now...

And I have always loved you from the deepest of my heart.

I am thinking about you every day, and dreaming about you every night.

Because you are avoiding me I started doing heavier drugs... You can't imagine in which situation I am right now.

If you'd see me right now, you'd cry your eyes off.

And all this just because you are avoiding me.

I lost more than half of my Family on the 6th of February. The Day of the Earthquake... Everyone who were precious to me.

And you were the last person in my life whom I could share my heart with.

You probably will read this and not respond to me anyways... So my fate is in your hands...

If you ever loved me even a little bit, contact me and tell me what is going on. What I did wrong.

Even if you broke up with me, tell me so that at least I know before my last breath. But the way you are ghosting me is hurting me so bad...

I can't take it anymore Lily, your distance from me is hurting me so much that I may even suicide. Because you brought joy in my life. I Love you :'( <3
